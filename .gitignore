#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments;
[cite_start]otherwise, check them in: [cite: 3]
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   [cite_start]According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control. [cite: 4]
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   [cite_start]install all needed dependencies. [cite: 5]
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   [cite_start]Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control. [cite: 6]
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   [cite_start]commonly ignored for libraries. [cite: 7]
#uv.lock

# poetry
#   [cite_start]Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control. [cite: 8]
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   [cite_start]commonly ignored for libraries. [cite: 9]

# pdm
#   [cite_start]Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control. [cite: 10]
#   [cite_start]pdm recommends including project-wide configuration in pdm.toml, but excluding .pdm-python. [cite: 11]
#   https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/project/#working-with-version-control

#pdm.toml

# pixi
#   [cite_start]Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pixi.lock in version control. [cite: 12]
#pixi.lock
#   Pixi creates a virtual environment in the .pixi directory, just like venv module creates one
#   in the .venv directory.
[cite_start]It is recommended not to include this directory in version control. [cite: 13]
